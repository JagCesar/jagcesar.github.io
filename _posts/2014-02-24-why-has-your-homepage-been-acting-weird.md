title: Why has your homepage been acting weird?
---

It's because I got fed up with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com) and decided to
move everything to a new tool. I wanted something more lightweight and
preferably a solution that didn't require me to maintain a server. So I googled
around and found a perfect tool named [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

I bet you've seen and heard about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). In case you
haven't it's basically tool that creates static files out of content files you
create. This blog post is for example a file with some text with
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in it. You can actually
see the entire source code for this page
[on my Github repo](https://github.com/JagCesar/jagcesar.github.io). You'll find
this post under the directory named "_posts".

I wanted my new homepage to look as similar as possible to the old one. So that
meant that I had to copy the CSS and Javascript from the default theme and adapt
it to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I hadn't been developing for the web lately
so I saw this as a perfect opportunity to brush up my skills. As you see it's
almost fully working, so if you want it, feel free to fork my repo :)

So you don't need a database, no software to maintain and not even a server to
host your page! Yup it's true. GitHub hosts these pages for free. The only thing
you need is a domain (if you want to be fancy).

If you want to try this out too, take a look at
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) which in a nice and easy manner tells
you what to do. And if you have any questions, feel free to drop me a question
on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JagCesar).
