There are a few answers to this question. Some answers are:

- Follow guidelines
- Copy others
- Follow instinct
- Ask people what they want

There might be more answers to that question, and actually all of them can be
the right answer. I've seen cases where a single designer has taken all the
design decisions, and the product ended up great. But sadly, this is not very
common.

The easiest and simplest way to enhance your User Experience is to test your
design on real people. Take your design, create a super quick prototype and go
to your nearest star bucks. Buy a stack of $5 dollar gift cards and ask people
to give your App a try. You would be amazed if you knew what people would do for
$5 dollar gift cards.

An important point of testing is documentation. You want to document as much as
possible during the testing process, but the how do you do that by yourself? I
use a tool called [LookBack](https://lookback.io). Once installed to your iOS
prototype it will record each users face, voice and touches on the screen. This
also makes it possible to test with users remotely.

One very important thing to keep in mind is to Never Ever make assumptions. I've
found myself making small, yet important assumptions. For example guessing the
age and if they are tech-savy or not. We do testing because we do not want to
make choices based on assumptions. Let's finish this off with a nice quite,
good luck testing!
