People keep name dropping UI, but I’ve noticed that not everybody know what it stands for and why it’s an important part of software engineering.

I googled “UI” real quick to see what the internet thought about it. This is the first sentence on the article about UI on wikipedia:

> “The **user interface**, in the industrial design field of human–machine interaction, is the space where interaction between humans and machines occurs.” – [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface)

When most people think about UI they imagine a computer or a smartphone. Basically a screen with some kind of input device so one can interact with the information on the screen. And yes, this is UI. But there is more to it.

[Siri](http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/), for example, is a kind of UI. The only difference is that instead of using your fingers to tap on a mouse or a screen, you use your voice to give her instructions. So everything that helps you interact with the hardware is  a UI. The small red LED that lights up when you turn your TV off is actually also a UI.

So, why is UI so important? Without UI we wouldn’t be able to use our computers, smartphones, TVs or even our cars. Yup, the steering wheel is also a UI (amongst other things in the car).

But that isn’t all. Now that you’ve understood why user interface is important, it’s even more important to face the fact that there are good and bad user interfaces. This is where **Interaction Design** (ID) comes in.

For example, if Siri only understood Swedish when launched in the US it would be a very poor interaction design. Siri would still be a user interface, but not a good one as all americans would need to learn Swedish to speak with her.

> An important thing to remember as an interaction designer is that you don’t want the user to think. The less the user has to think, the more **intuitive** the user interface will be.

An important thing to remember as an interaction designer is that you don’t want the user to think. The less the user has to think, the more **intuitive** the user interface will be. And the more intuitive the user interface is, the better **User Experience** (UX).

Of course there is a lot more to cover on these topics, but I hope this was enough to make you realise that features and cool functions isn’t everything. If all that awesomeness is hidden behind an incomprehensible UI, no one will ever see or enjoy all that awesomeness you’ve put there.
