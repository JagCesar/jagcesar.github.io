    <p>I will never call myself a senior developer. I believe that once you do 
that, you will stop listening to people who don't have that title in 
front of their names. I want to stay open minded.
</p>
<p>
I do not consider myself a hardcore programmer. I see myself as a 
creative geek with a passion for creating amazing software that in an 
easy and intuitive way offer the user the features needed to solve the 
task at hand. This is the the core of a great user experience.
</p>
<p>
I see programming as an art that is used to create solutions which 
makes the life of people better and easier. This is what I want to work 
with. Making people's lives better one step at a time. And if I run 
into something I don't understand, I'll just learn it.

<p>
How hard can it be?
