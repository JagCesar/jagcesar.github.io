      <p>I will never call myself a senior developer. I believe that once you do 
      that, you will stop listening to people who don't have that title in 
      front of their names. I want to stay open minded.
      </p>
      <p>
      I do not consider myself a hardcore programmer. I see myself as a 
      creative geek with a passion for creating amazing software that in an 
      easy and intuitive way offer the user the features needed to solve the 
      task at hand. This is the the core of a great user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      I see programming as an art that is used to create solutions which 
      makes the life of people better and easier. This is what I want to work 
      with. Making people's lives better one step at a time. And if I run 
      into something I don't understand, I'll just learn it.
      </p>
      <p>
      How hard can it be?

      <h2>Nutrif.io</h2>
      <p>There are several ways of tracking your daily active calories.
      They require minimum effort and even look good when you wear them.
      </p>
      <p>This data is however completely useless if you don't track your
      daily calorie intake. There are a few solutions out there today, 
      but we think they are too complicated and time consuming for the 
      regular user.</p>
      <p>Nutrif.io is the easiest way to keep track of your dietary 
      calories by simply scanning your daily snacks before you eat them.
      There is a lot more we want to do, so stay tuned for more amazing
      features.</p>
      <h2>Clippy</h2>
      <p>I get around using public transport here in San Francisco. To do that you get a "Clipper Card" which you charge with money. Then you just swipe it each time you are traveling by bus or subway.</p>
      <p>It works, but there is no easy way to easily check your balance. They do have a mobile website at m.clippercard.com. However the UX is terrible. For example, the first thing you see when you sign in is your name and where you live. To actually see your balance you have to scroll down to the bottom and tap your card. Terrible.</p>
      <p>I implemented and launched it, but sadly I ran into some trouble so I had to take it down from the App Store.</p>
      <h2>Wrapp</h2>
      <p>I wanted to work with Wrapp to see how it was to work with a startup and more importantly to work with the people working here. Some of my colleagues at Wrapp are successful entrepreneurs and have been part of creating big products in the past (Spotify and Rebtel for example). Working closely with these individuals means a lot to me as I get to pick their brains and learn how they work and how they make decisions.</p>
      <p>On the 2nd of September 2014 we decided to close down our San Francisco office. We had a new product idea we wanted to try, which would replace our current one. The best place to try it out would be our home court, we knew the market and we had the contacts. I was offered a position back in Sweden so I packed up my stuff and moved back home.</p>

      <p>This is my first job where I am "just" a developer, at previous employers I've always had something to say about the product. It's not in my comfort zone, which is a good thing. I will always continue to develop as long as I stay in the deep end of the pool.</p>
      <h2>Blocket</h2>
      <p>At first I was a hired as a Backend developer. But after a few weeks the stakeholder for the mobile team found out that I was an experienced iOS developer and they needed one as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>I began working with the iPhone and iPad App instead. There was a lot work that needed to be done with the Apps due to technical debt, which slowed down implementation of new features.</p>

      <p>After a year we decided to rewrite the App from scratch. I wrote the function specification to be able to verify that all functions existed in the new App when we were done. I was involved in choosing the design patterns and the interaction design. At first I was responsible for the overall interaction design but stakeholders at Blocket ignored my recommendations at multiple times. This forced me to step down from that position.</p>
      <h2>Other Apps I've worked with</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>TV4 Play</li>
        <li>Idol</li>
        <li>Unionen</li>
        <li>GS1</li>
      </ul>
