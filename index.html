		<p>People keep name dropping UI, but I’ve noticed that
not everybody know what it stands for and why it’s an important part of
software engineering.</p>
<p>I googled “UI” real quick to see what the internet thought about it.
This is the first sentence on the article about UI on wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The&nbsp;<b>user interface</b>, in the&nbsp;industrial
design&nbsp;field of&nbsp;human–machine interaction, is the space where
interaction between humans and machines occurs.” – <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>
<p>When most people think about UI they imagine a computer or a
smartphone. Basically a screen with some kind of input device so one can
interact with the information on the screen. And yes, this is UI. But
there is more to it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Siri</a>, for example, is a
kind of UI. The only difference is that instead of using your fingers to
tap on a mouse or a screen, you use your voice to give her
instructions.&nbsp;So everything that helps you interact with the
hardware is &nbsp;a UI. The small red LED that lights up when you turn
your TV off is actually also a UI.</p>
<p>So, why is UI so important? Without UI we wouldn’t be able to use our
computers, smartphones, TVs or even our cars. Yup, the steering wheel is
also a UI (amongst other things in the car).</p>
<p>But that isn’t all. Now that you’ve understood why user interface is
important, it’s even more important to face the fact that there are good
and bad user interfaces. This is where <strong>Interaction
Design</strong>&nbsp;(ID) comes in.</p>
<p>For example, if Siri only understood Swedish when launched in the US
it would be a very poor interaction design. Siri would still be a user
interface, but not a good one as all americans would need to learn
Swedish to speak with her.</p>
<blockquote><p>An important thing to remember as an interaction designer
is that you don’t want the user to think. The less the user has to
think, the more&nbsp;<strong>intuitive</strong>&nbsp;the user interface
will be.</p></blockquote>
<p>An important thing to remember as an interaction designer is that you
don’t want the user to think. The less the user has to think, the more
<strong>intuitive</strong> the user interface will be. And the more
intuitive the user interface is, the better <strong>User
Experience</strong> (UX).</p>
<p>Of course there is a lot more to cover on these topics, but I hope
this was enough to make you realise that features and cool functions
isn’t everything. If all that awesomeness is hidden behind
an&nbsp;incomprehensible UI, no one will ever see or enjoy all that
awesomeness you’ve put there.</p>
